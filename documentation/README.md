## About

BSB was designed to be a simple, expandable and server agnostic platform for simple, scalable microservice projects.  

From v8 of the BSB, a single container can be deployed with a linked volume to minize the storage space required for deployment.  
See [Docker Deployment](/Deployment)  for deployment configurations
  

## Getting started

- run the docker image with the required configuration.  

Look at the [Market](/Market) for a list of active plugins and how to use them
