BSB (Better-Service-Base) is an event-bus based microservice framework.  
It is completely opensource and can work as a single node, or geo-scaled cluster.  
Simplicity, flexibility and expandability were the key points when developing this framework.  
_(currently only in nodejs, however it is ready for several other languages)_
